For some [[Rings|ring]] $R$, [[Ideals|ideal]] $I$ and [[Quotient Rings|quotient ring]] always have a [[Homomorphisms|homomorphism]] $f:R\to R /I$, $r \mapsto \overline{r}=r+I$, this is the quotient map or the canonical map
## Every Ideal is a Kernel
We have seen that every kernal is an ideal, is every ideal the kernel of some homomorphism? Yes, the kernel of the quotient map is precisely $I$:
$$
\text{ker}(f)=\left\{ r\in  R\mid \overline{r} = \overline{0} \right\}=\left\{ r\in  R\mid r\in  I \right\}=I
$$
