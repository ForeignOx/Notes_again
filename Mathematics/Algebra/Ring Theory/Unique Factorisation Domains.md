## Definition
An [[Integral Domains|integral domain]] $R$ is called a [[Unique Factorisation|unique factorisation]] domain (UFD) if every non-zero non-[[Units|unit]] can be written as a product of [[Irreducibles|irreducible]] elements, and this product is unique up to the order of the factors and units
## Examples
We have [[Unique Factorisation#Theorem|proved]] that [[Integers|$\mathbb{Z}$]] and [[Polynomials|$\mathbb{F}[x]$]] are UFDs, and looking carefully at the proof, we see that the essential ingredient was the degree function $d$, such that we have division with remainder
Integral domains possessing such a degree function are called Euclidean domains (because of the [[Euclidean Algorithm|Euclidean algorithm]]), further examples include $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ (the Gaussian integers) or $\mathbb{Z}[\pm \sqrt{ 2 }]$. Thus every Euclidean domain is a UFD
We have seen that $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{ -5 }]$ is not a UFD, hence it is not an ED
## Remark
For a UFD, [[Prime Elements|prime]] $\iff$ irreducible
