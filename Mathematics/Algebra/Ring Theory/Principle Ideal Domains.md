Let $a,b\in \mathbb{Z}$, the ideal $(a,b)\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ generated by $a$ and $b$ consists of all elements of the form $ax+by$, $x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$ which we recognise from the euclidean algorithm, so letting $d=\gcd(a,b)$, then $\exists x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $ax+by=d$, thus $d\in(a,b)$. Moreover, $d$ divides $ax+by$ for any $x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$
Thus $(d)\subseteq(a,b)$ and $(a,b)\subseteq(d)$, so $(a,b)=(d)$
This means that any ideal generated by two or more elemnts, we can inductively reduce to $\hspace{0pt}1$. A similar thing holds for $\mathbb{F}[x]$
## Definition
An integral domain in which all ideals are principle (i.e. can be generated by a single element) is calld a principle ideal domain
## Theorem
The rings $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{F}[x]$ are principle ideal domains, or more generally, any Euclidean Domain (Ring with degree function such that we can divide with remainder) are PIDs
### Proof
Let $R$ be an ED, by definition, we have a degree function $d:R\setminus\left\{ 0 \right\}\to \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall a,b\in R$, $\exists q,r \in R$ such that
$$
a=qb+r,r=0\text{ or }d(r)<d(b)
$$
Now let $I$ be an ideal of $R$. If $I=(0)$, nothing to do
So assume $I\neq (0)$, then $\exists m\in I$ such that $m\neq 0$ such that $d(m)$ is minimal
Let $a\in I$ be an arbitrary element, we want to show that $a\in (m)$, i.e.  $a$ is a multiple of $m$
Dividing by $m$ with remainder:
$$
a=qm+r\implies r=a-qm
$$
By absorption, since $a,m\in I$, $r\in I$
$r=0$ or $d(r)<d(m)$. If $r=0$, then $m|a$, so $a\in (m)$, otherwise $d(r)<d(m)$,, but $d(m)$ is minimal for elements in $I$, so this i impossible, so $r=0$, thus $I=(m)$

$\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{F}[x]$ are thus PIDs, we also know that they are also [[Unique Factorisation Domains|UFDs]], in fact, we have more generally:
## Theorem
Any PID is a UFD!!
### Proof
Omitted :(
### Example
The ideal $(3,1+\sqrt{ -5 })$ in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{ -5 }]$ is not principle...
Assume that the ideal is generated by a single element $a\in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{ -5 }]$, i.e. $(a)=(3,1+\sqrt{ -5 })$
Then $3=ax,1+\sqrt{ -5 }=ay$ 
Apply the norm map: 
$$
N(3)=9=N(ax)=N(a)N(x)
$$
$$
 N(1+\sqrt{ -5 })=6=N(ay)=N(a)N(y)
$$
So we can say that $N(a)\in\left\{ 1,3,9 \right\}$ since it divides $9$, but also $N(a)\in(1,2,3,6)$, thus 
$$
N(a)\in\left\{ 1,3,9 \right\}\cap \left\{ 1,2,3,6 \right\}=\left\{ 1,3 \right\}
$$
As we have seen before, there is no element of norm $3$, also the only elements with norm $1$ are $\pm 1$, so $a=\pm 1$, hence $(a)=R$
Hence $1\in (3,1+\sqrt{ -5 })$, so we can write
$$
1=(a+b\sqrt{ -5 })3+(c+d\sqrt{ -5 })(1+\sqrt{ -5 })
$$
$$
= 3a+c-5d+(3b+c+d)\sqrt{ -5 }
$$
So we need $3b+c+d=0$, $3a+c-5d=1$. If we reduce each equation modulo $3$, then
$$
\overline{c}+\overline{d}=\overline{0}
$$
$$
 \overline{c}+\overline{d}=\overline{1}
$$
Which is a contradiction, soooo $(3,1+\sqrt{ -5 })$ is not principle
