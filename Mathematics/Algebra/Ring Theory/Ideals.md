## Definition
A [[Subsets|subset]] $I$ of a [[Rings|ring]] $R$ is called an ideal if it is closed under addition and satisfies the (left and right) absorption property i.e.
$$
\forall r\in  R,x\in I, rx\in  I,xr\in  I
$$
Note that absorption implies that an ideal $I$ is closed under taking negatives:
$$
x\in  I\implies-x=(-1)\cdot x\in  I
$$
In any ring $R$, we have the zero ideal $0=\left\{ 0 \right\}$ and $R$ itself are rings
## Examples
Let $R$ be a commutative ring, let
- $a\in R$, then $(a):=\left\{ ra\mid r \in R \right\}$ is an ideal of $R$, it is called the principle ideal generated by $a$
The ideal $n\mathbb{Z}$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ is just $n\mathbb{Z}$, the set of multiples of $n$, thus $n\mathbb{Z}=(n)$.
- Let $a_{1},\dots,a_{n}\in R$, then $(a_{1},\dots,a_{n}):=\left\{r_{1}a_{1}+r_{2}a_{2}+\dots+r_{n}a_{n}\mid r_{i} \in R  \right\}$ which is called the ideal generated by $a_{1},\dots,a_{n}$

Consider the "evaluation map" $\varphi:\mathbb{Q}[x]\to \mathbb{Q}$ given by $\varphi(f(x))=f(0)$. This is a homomorphism, it is also surjective: $\forall a\in \mathbb{Q}$, take $f(x)=x+a$, then $\varphi(f(x))=f(0)=a$, $$
\text{ker}(\varphi)=\left\{ f(x)\in\mathbb{Q}[x]\mid f(0)=0 \right\}=\left\{ xg(x)\mid g(x)\in \mathbb{Q}[x] \right\}=(x)
$$We prove this  by seeing that $f(x)=q(x)x+r(x)$ and so $\deg r<1$, so $0=f(0)=r(0)$, or $r(x)=0$, but $r(x)$ is a constant, so $r(x)=0$.
## Left/Right Ideals
For non-commutative rings, we have left/right ideals defined as above are sometimes called two-sided ideals
### Example
$R=M_{n}(\mathbb{F})$, $a\in R$, then 
$$
Ra=\left\{ Pa\mid P\in  R \right\},aR=\left\{ aP\mid P \in  R \right\},RaR=\left\{ PaQ\mid P,Q\in  R \right\}
$$
Then $Ra$ is a left ideal, $aR$ a right ideal and $RaR$ is a two-sided ideal

Let $R$ be any ring, then $I\subseteq R$ be an ideal and suppose that $I$ contains a [[Units|unit]] $u\in R^{\times}$. Then by absorption, $u^{-1} u\in I$, $r\cdot1=r \in I,\forall r\in R$, then $I=R$, the trivial ideal.
In particular, for a field, when $R$ is a field, every non-zero element is a unit, so we only have the zero ideal and the trivial ideal (and no other ideals)
## Equivalnce Class Defined by an Ideal
Let $R$ be a ring and $I\subseteq R$ an ideal, then two elements $x,y\in R$ are equivalent/congruent, f
$$
x-y\in  I
$$
We sometimes also write this as $x\equiv y \mod I$
Moreover, for any $x\in R$, the coset of $x$ modulo $I$ is
$$
\overline{x}=\left\{ x+r\mid r\in  I \right\}=\left\{ y\in  R\mid x-y\in  I \right\}=x+I
$$
$x$ is said to be a representative of $\overline{x}$ (in fact, any element in $\overline{x}$ is a representative)
Note that $\overline{x}$ is precisely the set of all $y\in R$ such that $x\equiv y \mod I$. Indeed, if $y\in x+I$, then $x-y=-r\in I$, conversely, if $x-y\in I$, then there exists $r\in I$ such that $x-y=r,y=x-r\\in x+I$
### Example
[[Integers|$\mathbb{Z}$]] with the ideal $n\mathbb{Z}$, we say that $x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$ are [[Equivalence Relation|equivalent]] or conguent if $x\equiv y \mod n$, i.e. $n|(x-y)$, i.e. if $x-y\in n\mathbb{Z}$
We have denoted elements of $\mathbb{Z} /n$ by $\overline{a}$, but these elements are really defined as equivalence classes, i.e. the set of all $x\in \mathbb{Z}$ which are equivalent to $a$, for example
$$
\overline{0}\in  \mathbb{Z} /n,\overline{0}=\left\{ x\in \mathbb{Z}\mid x-0\in  n\mathbb{Z} \right\}
$$
$$
 \overline{1}=\left\{ x\in \mathbb{Z}\mid x-1\in n\mathbb{Z} \right\}=\left\{ 1+ny\mid y\in  \mathbb{Z} \right\}=1+n\mathbb{Z}
$$

Consider $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ with the ideal $I=(x^{2}+x+1)$. Again define, two elements $a,b\in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ to be equivalent/congruent mod $I$ if $a-b\in I$, and denote the equivalence class of $a$ by $\overline{a}$. Also define
$$
\overline{a}+\overline{b}:=\overline{a+b},\,  \overline{a}\cdot\overline{b}:=\overline{ab}
$$
Then, for example, $\overline{x^{2}+x+1}=\overline{0}$ (as it is inside the ideal itself), so $\overline{x^{2}}=\overline{-x-1}$
Now if $p(x)\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$, we can write $p(x)=q(x)(x^{2}+x+1)+r(x)$, where $\deg r<\deg(x^{2}+x+1)=2$, then
$$
p(x)-r(x)\in (x^{2}+x+1)\implies p(x)\equiv r(x) \mod (x^{2}+x+1)
$$
This means that any polynomial in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is equivalent to one of degree less than 2
Hence, $\overline{p(x)}=\overline{r(x)}$
Here $r(x)$ is said to be a representative of $\overline{p(x)}$ (of degree less than 2)
For example, if $p(x)=x^{4}-3x^{2}+2$, using $\overline{x^{2}}=\overline{-x-1}$, we can rewrite as:
$$
\overline{x^{4}}=\overline{x^{2}}^{2}=\overline{-x-1}^{2}=\overline{(-x-1)^{2}}
$$
$$
= \overline{x^{2}+2x+1}=\overline{x^{2}+x+1}+\overline{x}=\overline{0}+\overline{x}=\overline{x}
$$
This means that $\overline{p(x)}=\overline{x}- \overline{3(-x-1)}+\overline{2}=\overline{4x+5}$, so here $4x+5$ is a representative for $p(x)$
### Lemma
The cosets $\mod I$ form a partition of $R$.
#### Proof
We need every coset is non-empty, The two cosets are either disjoint or equal, the union of all cosets
The first part is clear because $x$ is always in $\overline{x}=x+I$
For the second part, we need to let $x,y\in R$, and suppose that $z\in(x+I)\cup(y+I)$, then $x-z\in I$ and $y-z\in I$, hence
$$
(x-z)-(y-z)=x-y\in  I
$$
So that $x+I=y+I$
Finally the union of 
___
### More Coset things
For a ring $R$ with ideal $I\subseteq R$, our ideal the cosets $\mod I$,
$$
\overline{x}=x+I,x\in  R
$$
$$
 \overline{y}=y+I,y\in  R
$$
$$
x+I=y+I \iff x-y \in  I \iff \overline{x}= \overline{y}
$$
#### Example
Let $R= \mathbb{Z}[i]$, and $I=(2-i)$, what is $R /I$?
The first thing to do is to find representatives for its elements. Every element of $R /I$ is of the form $a+bi+(2-i)$, for $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$, when are two elements equal? 
Since $2-i+(2-i)=0+(2-i)$, we have $\overline{2-i}=\overline{0}$, so $\overline{2}=\overline{i}$, then
$$
\overline{a+bi}=\overline{a}+\overline{bi}=\overline{a}+\overline{2b}=\overline{a+2b}
$$
This means that any element in $R /I$ has a representative that lies in $\mathbb{Z}$. We can restric even further, namely,
$$
\overline{2}=\overline{i}\implies \overline{4}=\overline{-1}\implies \overline{5}= \overline{0}
$$
So the equivalence classes or cosets are only different modulo $5$, that is, there are at most $\hspace{0pt}5$ elements; $0+I,1+I,2+I,3+I,4+I$
Is is possible to reduce further? Assume that $\hspace{0pt}2$ of these elements are equal:
$$
a+I=b+I
$$
This means that $a-b\in I$, so $a-b=(x+yi)(2-i)$ for some $x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$, then
$$
a-b=2x+y+(2y-x)i
$$
$$
\begin{cases}
2x+y=a-b \\
2y-x=0 
\end{cases}
$$
$$
\implies 5y=a-b \iff a\equiv b\mod 5
$$
So our $\hspace{0pt}5$ representatives all give distince element and $R /I$ has $\hspace{0pt}5$ elements
## Prime and Maximal Ideals
Let $R$ be a commutative ring, $I\subseteq R$ a proper ideal, ie. $I\neq R$, then I is said to be a [[Prime Elements|prime]] ideal if 
$$
\forall a,b\in  R:ab\in  I\implies a\in  I,b\in  I
$$
The ideal $I$ is called maximal if the only ideals of $R$ that contain $I$ are $I$ itself and $R$
(equivalently if there is no ideal strictly between $I$ and $R$, so there is no $J$ such that $I\subset J\subseteq R$)
If $x\in R$ is a prime element, then the ideal it generates, $(x)$ is a prime ideal
Indeed, if $ab\in (x)$, then $ab=xr$ for some $r\in R$, so $x|ab$, so if $x$ is a prime element, $x|a$ or $x|b$
This means exactly that $a\in (x)$ or $b\in(x)$, so $(x)$ is a prime ideal
Conversely, if $(x)$ is a prime ideal, then $x$ is a prime element, because
$$
x|ab\implies ab\in (x)\implies a\in (x)\text{ or }b\in (x)
$$
We also see from this that
$$
a\in (x)\iff (a)\subseteq(x) \iff x|a
$$
This can be summarised in the slogan "to contain is to divide"
### Example
- For $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ a prime number $\iff (p)=p\mathbb{Z}$ is a non-zero prime ideal
- $(0)\subseteq R$ is a prime ideal in $R$ iff $R$ is an integral domain (Proof: we always have that $ab\in (0)\iff ab=0$, so if $(0)$ is a prime ideal, then $a=0$ or $b=0$, i.e. $R$ is an integral domain. The converse follows similarly)
- $(2)$ is not a prime ideal in $\mathbb{Z}[i]:(1-i)(1+i)=2\in (2)$, but $1\pm i \not\in (2)$
- $x^{2}+1\in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ is irreducible and also a prime element, by the abover, $(x^{2}+1)$ is a prime ideal in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$. The same thing holds for any irreducible polynomial in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$
### Lemma
If $I\subseteq R$ is a maximal ideal, then it is also prime
#### Proof
Suppose $I$ is maximal and that $ab\in I$, for $a,b\in R$. We want $a\in I$ or $b\in I$
If $a\in I$, then we are done, so we assume $a\not\in I$
Let $J=(I,a)$ (generated by everythign in $I$, together with $a$).
Since $J\supsetneq I$, we must have $J=R$ as $I$ is maximal. Thus $1 \in J$, so
$$
b\in  bJ=(bI,ba)\subseteq (I,ab)
$$
Thus, either $a\in I$ or $b\in I$
### Proposition
Let $R$ be commutative and $I\subseteq R$ is an ideal, then
- $I$ is prime iff $R /I$ is an integral domain
- $I$ is maximal iff $R /I$ is a field
#### Proof
- If $I$ is prime and $\overline{ab}= \overline{0}$, then we want to prove that either $\overline{a}=\overline{0}$ or $\overline{b}=\overline{0}$, then $ab\in I$, since $I$ is prime, $a\in I$ or $b\in I$, i.e. $\overline{a}= \overline{0}$ or $\overline{b}= \overline{0}$, thus $R /I$ is an integral domain
    Conversely, if $R /I$ is an integral domain, and $ab\in I$, then we want either $a\in I$ or $b\in I$. Then $\overline{ab}= \overline{0}$, so, since it is an integral domain, either $\overline{a}= \overline{0}$ or $\overline{b}=\overline{0}$, so $a\in I$ or $b\in I$, so $I$ is prime :)
- First assume $I$ is maximal, we want to prove every element in $R /I$ is invertible. Any non-zero element in $R /I$ has a representative $x\in R$ such that $x\not\in I$, then $(I,x)=R=(1)$, so $\exists y\in R$ and $m\in I$ such that $xy+m=1$, this means $\overline{xy+m}=\overline{xy}=\overline{1}$, so $\overline{x}$ is invertible with inverse $\overline{y}$ in $R/ I$ 
    Conversely, if $R/I$ is a field and $x\in R$ such that $x\not\in I$, then $\exists \overline{y}\in R/I$ such that $\overline{x} \overline{y}=\overline{1}$ as it is a field. This means that $xy-1=m\in I$. Then $(x,I) \supseteq (1+m) \supseteq(1)=R$. Thus $(x,I)=R$, hence $I$ is maximal.
