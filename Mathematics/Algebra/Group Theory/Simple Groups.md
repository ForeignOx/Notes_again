## Definition
A [[Groups|group]] is called simple if its only [[Normal Subgroups|normal]] [[Subgroups|subgroups]] ae the trivial group $\left\{ \varepsilon \right\}$ or the whole group itself
## Examples
For examples $\mathbb{Z}_{2},\mathbb{Z}_{3},A_{5}$ are simple. $A_{5}$ is the smallest non-abelian finite simple group
The classification of finite simple groups, completed in $\hspace{0pt}2004$, is very long. The full write-up of this is in progress
## Simple Abelian Groups
Every subgroup of an [[Abelian Groups|abelian]] group is normal, so simple abelian groups are those with no subgroups, so only $\mathbb{Z} /p$ are simple abelian groups
(for any other abelian group you can take a subgroup which is a cyclic group)
## Simple Symmetric Groups
[[Symmetric Groups|$S_{n}$]] is not [[Simple Groups|simple]] for $n\geq 3$ since $A_{n} \lhd S_{n}$
## Alternating Groups
$A_{4}$ is not simple as the two normal subgroups of $S_{4}$ are $A_{4}$ and $\left\{ e,\begin{pmatrix}a&b\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}c & d\end{pmatrix} \right\}\subseteq A_{4}$
$A_{n}$ is simple for $n\geq 5$ (proof omitted)
