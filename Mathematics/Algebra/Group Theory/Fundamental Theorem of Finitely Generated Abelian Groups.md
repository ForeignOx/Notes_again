## Theorem
Let $G$ be a finitely generated abelilan group, then
$$
G\cong \mathbb{Z} /a_{1} \times \mathbb{Z} \times a_{2} \times\dots \times \mathbb{Z} /a_{k}\times \mathbb{Z}^{r}
$$
Such that $a_{1}|a_{2}|\dots|a_{k},r\geq 0$, this presentation is unique
This is a generalisation of the [[Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups|fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups]] 
Here we call $r$ the rank of $G$, and $\left\{ a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{k} \right\}$ torsion coefficients
