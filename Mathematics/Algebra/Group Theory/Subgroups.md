## Definition
A subgroup of a [[Groups|group]] $(G,*)$ is a non-empty subset $H$ of $G$ which itself forms a group, under the same binary operation $*$
The trivial subgroup is $\{e\}$
Proper subgroups are any subgroups that are strictly smaller than the original group, so $H\neq G$ (sometimes proper also means non-trivial)
Checking closure of a subset is enough to tell it is a subgroup:
- $e\in H$
- $\forall h_{1},h_{2}\in H,h_{1}h_{2}\in H$
- $\forall h\in H,h^{-1}\in H$
Sometimes people denote subgroups as $H<G$
## Examples
For any group $G$, for any $g\in G$, then $g$ generates the [[Cyclic Groups|cyclic]] subgroup $\left< g \right>$, for example $\left< \overline{2} \right>\in \mathbb{Z} /6$ is equal to $\left\{ \overline{2},\overline{4},\overline{0} \right\}$, or $\left< r \right>\in D_{4}$ is equal to $\left\{ e,r,r^{2},r^{3} \right\}$, or $n\mathbb{Z}$ in $\mathbb{Z}$
Let $G=M_{n}(\mathbb{R})$ under addition, $H=\left\{ \text{diagonal matrices in }G \right\}$ is a subgroup
In fact, any [[Subspaces|subspace]] of a [[Vectorspaces|vectorspace]] is a subgroup under addition
