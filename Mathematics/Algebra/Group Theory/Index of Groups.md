## Definition
If $G$ is a finite [[Groups|group]] and $H\subseteq G$ is a [[Subgroups|subgroup]], then $\frac{\left| G \right|}{\left| H \right|}$ is called the index of $H$ in $G$, which we denote $[G:H]$
The index of a group is the number of [[Cosets|left cosets]]. We know it must be an integer by [[Lagrange's Theorem|Lagrange's theorem]]
## Remark
For infinite groups, we define $[G:H]$ as the number of left cosets of $H$ in $G$
## Examples
$G=\mathbb{Z}$ $H=2\mathbb{Z}\implies [G:H]=2$
