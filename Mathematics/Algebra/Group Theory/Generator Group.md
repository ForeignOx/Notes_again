## Definition
If we have $G$ as a group, and $S\subset G$
$S$ is a set of generators of $G$ if every element of $G$ is a product of $S$ and their inverses; $G=\left< S \right>$
## Example
The [[Dihedral Groups|dihedral group]], can be written as $D=\left< r,s \right>$, so $s,r$ are generators
If $\left| S \right|=1$, then $G$ is called [[Cyclic Groups|cyclic]], so $\mathbb{Z}_{n}=\left<  \overline{1} \right>$, as $\overline{a}=(\overline{1})^{a}=a\cdot \overline{1}$, also $\mathbb{Z}=\left< 1 \right>$
