Mathematically, a symmetry is a transformation that carries an object into itself. In geometric situations, one oftenputs natural r3estrictions on the transformations, for instance, that they be isometries (length preserving)
For a regular n-sided polygon, its symmetries are given by $D_{n}$ (dihedral [[Groups|group]]), it has $2n$ elements, $n$ rotations (one of which is the identity) and $n$ reflections
