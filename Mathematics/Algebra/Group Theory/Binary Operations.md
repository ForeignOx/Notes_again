If $R$ is a [[Sets|set]], a binary operation is a function $f:R\times R\to R$, $(x,y)\mapsto f(x,y)$, for example $+(x,y)\mapsto x+y$
A binary operation is required to make $(R,f)$ a [[Groups|group]]
Some binary operations such as $+$ make $(R,+)$ into an [[Abelian Groups|abelian group]] as $+$ is commutative
