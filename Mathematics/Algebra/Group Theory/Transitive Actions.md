## Definition
An [[Group Action|action]] of the [[Groups|group]] $G$ on the [[Sets|set]] $X$ is transitive if $\text{orb}(x)=X\forall x\in X$, i.e. there is only one [[Orbits and Stabilisers|orbit]]
## Example
Consider the tranlation action of $\mathbb{Z}$ on $\mathbb{R}$ where $n*x=n+x$, $\text{orb}(x)=x+\mathbb{Z}$, which takes different values depending on $x$, so there are infinitely many orbits, so clearly not trnasitive
Consider the action of $\mathbb{Z}$ on $\mathbb{R}$, $n*x=(-1)^{n}x$, $\text{orb}(x)=\left\{ \pm x \right\}$, which is different for each $x$, so also not transitive
___
[[Distance Preserving Maps|Distance preserving maps]] are transitive:
The action on lines in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is also transitive, as we can shift and then rotate
The action on circles is not transitive as a small circle cannot be mapped to a bit circle by distance-preserving maps
___
The action of a group $G$ on itself by left multiplication, consider $g,h\in G$, we can always say $x h=h x\implies x=g^{-1}h$ si transitive
___
The action of $G$ on itself by conjugation is not transitive (unless $G=\left\{ e \right\}$)beacause $d$ is alwaus a separate orbit
___
The [[Dihedral Groups|dideral group]] $D_{n}$ acts transitively on vertices of a regular $n$-gon
$D_{n}$ also acts transitively on the edges of the regular $n$-gon
If $v$ is a vertex of an $n$-gon, then 
$$
\text{stab}(v)=\left\{ e,s \right\}
$$
The stabiliser acts stransitively on edges of the $n$-gon with endpoint at $v$
## Regular Polygons
So we can define a regular polygon whose symmetry group acts transitiely on vertices and stabilisers of any vertex act transitively on neighbouring edges
### Remark
Note that it is not enough to require transitivity on vertices, as some irregular polyhedra satisfy this
