Formally, a symmetry is a transformaion of an object or [[Sets|set]] $X$ into itself, a [[Bijective Functions|bijective]] [[Functions|map]] $f:X\to X$ which preserves the structure of $X$
Moreover, there exists an identity symmedtry $Id$ which doesn't change $X$
We can [[Composition of Functions|compose]] two symmetries $f$ and $g$:
$$
f\circ g:X\overset{g} \to   X\overset{f}\to X
$$
Every symmetry is inveertible, so that for every $f$ there exists $f^{-1}$ such that
$$
f\circ f^{-1} = f^{-1}\circ f=Id
$$
