## Definition
If a [[Vectorspaces|vectorspace]] $V$ is also closed under multiplication, (as well as addition and scalar multiplication), then $V$ is an algebra:
$$
\forall u,v\in  V,uv\in  V
$$
## Examples
The general [[Functions|function]] space [[Product Sets|$\mathbb{R}^{A}$]] and the [[Subspaces|subspace]] $\mathcal{C}([a,b])$ of $\mathbb{R}^{[a,b]}$ both have the property that they are closed under the operation of multiplication of two functions. That is, the pairwise product of two functions is again a function:
$$
(fg)(a)=f(a)g(a)
$$
And the product of two continuous functions is continuous
Note that [[Linear Maps|Linear Maps]] are not algebras in general
