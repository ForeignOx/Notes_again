In plane goemetry, when we are considering two congruent figures that are similarly oriented, we often think of obtaining one from the other by "sliding the plane along itself" in such a way that all lines remain parallel to their original positions
## Definition
This description of a parallel translation of the plane can be more elegantly stated as the condition that every directed [[Lines|line]] segment slides to an equivalent one:
If $X$ slides to $Y$ and $O$ slides to $B$, then $OX$ slides to $BY$, so that $OX\sim BY$ and $\underline{x}=\underline{y}-\underline{b}$
Therefore, the coordinate form of such a parallel sliding is the [[Functions|mapping]]
$$
\underline{x}\mapsto \underline{y}=\underline{x}+\underline{b}
$$
Conversely, for any $\underline{b}\in \mathbb{R}^{2}$, the plane mapping defined by $\underline{x}\mapsto \underline{y}=\underline{x}+\underline{b}$ is easily seen to be a parallel translation, so these considerations hold equally well for parallel translations of [[Euclidean Space|Euclidean space]] and hence we can consider the definition to be the same for any object in $\mathbb{E}^{n}$
It is geometrically clear that under a parallel translation [[Planes|planes]] map to parallel planes and lines
