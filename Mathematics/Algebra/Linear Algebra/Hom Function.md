[[Linear Maps|Linear transformations]] have the very important property that the sum of two [[Linear|linear]] transformations is linear and the composition of two transformations is linear
## Definition
If $W$ is a [[Vectorspaces|vectorspace]] and $A$ is any [[Sets|set]], we know that the space [[Product Spaces|$W^{A}$]] of all mappings $f:A\to W$ is a vectorspace of vector-valued [[Functions|fiunctions]]
If $A$ is itself a vectorspace $V$, we naturally single out for special study the subset $Hom(V,W)$
