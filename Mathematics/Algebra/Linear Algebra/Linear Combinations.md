## Definition
A [[Vectors|vector]] $\beta$ is called a [[Linear|Linear]] combination of a [[Subsets|subset]] $A$ of a [[Vectorspaces|vectorspace]] $V$ if $\beta$ i a finite [[Sum|sum]] $\sum x_{i}\alpha_{i}$, where the vectors $\alpha_{i}\in A$, and the scalars $x_{i}\in \mathbb{F}$
If $A$ is finite, it is often useful to take the [[Sets of Indices|indexed set]] $\left\{ \alpha_{i} \right\}$ to be the whole of $A$, and simply use a coefficient of $\hspace{0pt}0$ for any vector missing from the sum
## Example
If $A$ is the subset $\left\{ t^{n} \right\}_{0}^{\infty}\subset \mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{R}}$ of all monomials, then a function $f$ i a linear combination of the functions in $A$ iff $f$ is a [[Polynomials|polynomial]] [[Functions|function]] 
$$
f(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}t^{i}

If $A$ is the subset $\left\{ \sin t,\cos t,e^{ t } \right\}\subset \mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{R}}$, then we can consider $A$ an [[Ordered Pairs|ordered triple]] in the listed ordering, and the function $3\sin t-e^{ t }=3\cdot \sin t+0\cdot \cos t+(-1)\cdot e^{ t }$ is the linear combination of the triple $A$, having the coefficient triple $(3,0,-1)$

Conider the set $L$ of all linear combinations of the two vectors $(1,1,1)$ and $(0,1,-1)$ in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, it is the set of all vectors:
$$
s(1,1,1)+t(0,1,-1)=(s,s+t,s-t)
$$
Where $s,t\in\mathbb{R}$. Thus
$$
L=\left\{ (s,s+t,s-t)\mid (s,t)\in \mathbb{R}^{2} \right\}
$$
It will be clear on inspection that $L$ is closed under addition and scalar multiplication, and therefore is a [[Subspaces|subspace]] of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
Also $L$ contains each of the two given vectors, with coefficient pairs $(1,0),(0,1)$ respectively
Any subspace $M$ of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ which contains each of the two given vectors will also contain all of their linear combinations, so will include $L$
That is, $L$ is the smallest subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ containing $(1,1,1)$ and $(0,1,-1)$. It is called the [[Linear Span|linear span]] of the two vectors or the subspace generated by the two vectors
