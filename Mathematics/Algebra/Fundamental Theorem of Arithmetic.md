Let [[Natural Numbers|$n\in \mathbb{N}$]], $n>1$, then $n$ can be written as a product of primes in a unique way (up to the order of the factors and factors of $\pm 1$). More precisely, there are distinct primes $p_{1},\dots,p_{r}$ and exponents $e_{1},\dots,e_{r}\in\mathbb{N}$ such that:
$$
n=p_{1}^{e_{1}}\dots p_{r}^{e_{r}}=\prod_{i=1}^{r}p_{i}^{e_{i}}
$$
And if $n=q_{1}^{f_{1}}\dots q_{s}^{f_{s}}$, for some primes $q_{i},f_{i}\in \mathbb{N},s \in\mathbb{N}$, then $r=s$, and up to reordering, $p_{i}=q_{i}$, and $e_{i}=f_{i}$ for all $i$.
