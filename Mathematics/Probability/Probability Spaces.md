There are $\hspace{0pt}3$ ingredients to a [[Probabilities|probability]] space:
- A [[Sample Spaces|sample space]] $\Omega$, which is just a [[Sets|set]]
- A [[Sigma Algebra|sigma algebra]] or a sigma field
- A [[Probabilities|probability]] [[Functions|function]] $\mathbb{P}$
Intuitively $\Omega$ consists of all outcomes of a randomised experiment
