$\mathfrak{F}$ is a collection of [[Subsets|subsets]] of [[Sample Spaces|$\Omega$]] is called a $\sigma$-algebra if it satisfies the following properties:
- $\Omega \in\mathfrak{F}$
- If $A\in\mathfrak{F},A^c\in\mathfrak{F}$
- If a countably infinite collection $A_{1},A_{2},\dots \in\mathfrak{F}$, then $\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_{n}\in\mathfrak{F}$ 
$\mathfrak{F}$ is a collection of all [[Events|events]]:
$$
A\subseteq\Omega \forall A\in \mathfrak{F}
$$
In general however, if $\Omega$ is uncountable, it is too much to demand that $\mathbb{P}$ satisfying the axioms of [[Probabilities|probability]] should be defined on all subsets of $\Omega$. The essence of the reason, is that for uncountable sample spaces, such as $\Omega=[0,1]$, there exist subsets of $\Omega$ that cannot be assigned a probability in a way that is consistent with the axioms. The constructionn of such non-measurable sets is also the basis of the famous Banach-Tarski paradox. Uncountable $\Omega$ are unavoidable, and examples occur whenever we have an experiment whose outcome is modelled by a [[Continuous Random Variables|continuous distribution]] 
If $\Omega$ is discrete, we can always take 
$$
\mathfrak{F}=2^{\Omega}
$$
so that every subset of $\Omega$ is an event, it is easy to see that it is the biggest possible $\sigma$-algebra over $\Omega$
For uncountable $\Omega$ however, the set $2^{\Omega}$ may be too unwiieldy, in which case we would consider a smaller $\sigma$-algebra
The trivial $\sigma$-algebra $\{ \emptyset,\Omega \}$ is the smallest possible $\sigma$-algevra over $\Omega$, but it carries no information about the outcome of an experiment
## Generated $\sigma$-fields
### Proposition
Suppose $\mathfrak{F}_{\alpha},\alpha \in \mathfrak{I}$ is a collection of $\sigma$-fields on a sample space $\Omega$. Then
$$
\mathfrak{G}=\bigcap_{\alpha \in \mathfrak{I}}\mathfrak{F}_{\alpha}
$$
Is also a $\sigma$-field
#### Proof
- We need to show that $\Omega \in \mathfrak{G}$
- If $A\in \mathfrak{G}$, then $A^{c}\in \mathfrak{G}$
- If $A_{1},A_{2},\dots \in\mathfrak{G}$ then $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}\in \mathfrak{G}$
For the first, we know that $\Omega \in \mathfrak{F}_{\alpha}$ for every $\alpha \in\mathfrak{I}$, thus
$$
\Omega \in \bigcap_{\alpha \in  \mathfrak{I}}\mathfrak{F}_{\alpha}
$$
For the second, if $A\in \mathfrak{G}$, then $A\in \mathfrak{F}_{\alpha}$ for every $\alpha \in\mathfrak{I}$
Then $A^{c}\in\mathfrak{F}_{\alpha}$ for every $\alpha$
Then $A^{c}\in \bigcap_{\alpha \in\mathfrak{I}}\mathfrak{F}_{\alpha}=\mathfrak{G}$
For the third, if $A_{n}\in \mathfrak{G}$ for every $n$, thus $A_{n}\in \mathfrak{F}_{\alpha}$ for every $\alpha$ an $n$, since
$$
\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}\in  \mathfrak{F}_{\alpha} \forall\alpha
$$
Then
$$
\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}\in \bigcap_{\alpha \in \mathfrak{I}}\mathfrak{F}_{\alpha}=\mathfrak{G}
$$

### Definition
Let $\mathcal{X}$ be an arbitrary set and $\mathcal{D}$ be an arbitrary collection of subsets of $\mathcal{X}$. Let $\mathcal{F}_{\alpha},\alpha \in\mathcal{A}$ be the collection of all sigma algebras in $\mathcal{X}$ which contain $\mathcal{D}$, namely, $\mathcal{D}\subset \mathcal{F}_{\alpha}$ for all $\alpha \in\mathcal{A}$, then
$$
\mathcal{G}:= \mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{D}}=\bigcap_{\alpha \in \mathcal{A}}\mathcal{F}_{\alpha}
$$
is the smallest sigma algebra of subsets of $\mathcal{X}$ containing $\mathcal{D}$, also known as the $\sigma$ algebra generated by $\mathcal{D}$
### Remark
Informally, one could try to construct $\mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{D}}$ starting from the collection of sets
$$
\mathcal{D}_{0}:= \mathcal{D}\cup \left\{ \mathcal{X},\emptyset \right\}
$$
And then repeatedly apply the countable union property of sigma algebras. When constructing probability spaces, however, it is not immediately clear that each such resulting countable union can be prescrived a probability value in a unique way
On the other hand, thanks to the continuity property of probabilities along monotone sequences of events, one can restrict such extensions to monotone operations only. Namely, if $A_{1}\subset A_{2}\subset\dots$ belonging to $\mathcal{D}_{0}$, add $\bigcup_{k\geq 1}A_{k}$ to $\mathcal{D}_{0}$; similarly, if $B_{1}\supset B_{2}\supset\dots$ belong to $\mathcal{D}_{0}$, add $\bigcap_{k\geq 1}B_{k}$ to $\mathcal{D}_{0}$
Any collection containing all sets from the last two properties (namely, with each increasing sequence $A_{k}$ containing its union, as well as with each decreasing sequence $B_{k}$ containing its intersection) is called a monotone class
An important result in real analysis is that the smallest monotone class containing $\mathcal{D}_{0}$ and the smallest sigma field containing $\mathcal{D}_{0}$ coincide
#### Examples
One event $A$, we want to find $\sigma(\left\{ A \right\})$, we claim
$$
\sigma(\left\{ A \right\})=\left\{ \emptyset,\Omega,A,A^{c} \right\}
$$
