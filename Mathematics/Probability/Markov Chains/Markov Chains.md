## Definition
For a countable collection of states, $I$, we consider $I$-valued [[Random Variables|random variables]] $X:\Omega\to I$, where the distribution of $X$ will be the vector $\lambda:I\to[0,1]$ given by $\lambda(i):=\mathbb{P}(X=i)$
We always think of these distributions as row [[Vectors|vectors]] for simplicity
We encode the random choices using [[Stochastic Matrices|stochastic matrices]]
## Example
Consider this following directed grap
