We want to estimate or predict if and when something will happen with [[Markov Chains|Markov chains]]
For example let $A\subset I$ be a thing of interest, for example $A=\left\{ i\in I:\middle|:\text{ it is raining} \right\}$ if the set of states is the set of possible weather patterns. Importantly $A=\left\{ i \right\}$ for some state $i$
## Definition
The hitting time of some subset of states $A\subset I$ is the [[Random Variables|random variable]] 
$$
H^{A}:\Omega\to \mathbb{N}_{0}\cup \left\{ \infty \right\}
$$
is defined by
$$
H^{A}:=\min\left\{  \right\}
