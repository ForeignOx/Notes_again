## Definition
A [[Markov Chains|Markov chain]] is irreducible if it consists of only one [[Communicating Classes|communicating class]]. In other words, for all $i,j\in I$, there exists $n,i_{0},i_{1},\dots,i_{n-1},i_{n}$ with $i_{0}=i,i_{n}=j$ and $P_{i_{0}i_{1}}P_{i_{1}i_{2}}\dots P_{i_{n-1}i_{n}}>0$
Otherwise it is reducible
