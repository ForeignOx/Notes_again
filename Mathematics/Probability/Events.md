Events are one of the basic building blocks of probability. Events are [[Sets|sets]], they are [[Subsets|subsets]] of the [[Sample Spaces|sample space]]. The [[Empty Set|empty set]] is the event that there is no [[Outcomes|outcome]]
We say that an event $A$ occurs when the outcome that occurs at the end of the scenario is in the set $A$
## Definitions
If a set $A\in \mathfrak{F}$ (it is in the [[Sigma Algebra|sigma algebra]]) then $A$ is an event
