## Definition
A sequence of [[Random Variables|random variables]] $X_{1},X_{2},\dots$ with [[Cumulative Distribution Functions|cdf]] $F_{X_{1}}(\cdot),F_{X_{2}}(\cdot),\dots$ is said to converge to a random variable $X$ with cdf $F_{X}(\cdot)$ in distribution if
$$
\lim_{ n \to \infty } F_{X_{n}}(x)=F_{X}(x)\forall x\in \mathbb{R}
$$
Where $F_{X}(\cdot)$ is continuous
And is written:
$$
X_{n} \overset{d}{\to} X
$$
## Theorem
If we have [[Probability Generating Functions|probability generating functions]] $G_{X_{n}}(s)\to G_{X}(s)$ for every $s$ with $\left| s \right|\leq 1$, then $X_{n}\to X$ in distribution
