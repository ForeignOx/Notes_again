A thought experiment to show that ways of thinking of probabilities can cause confusion
## Paradox
A chord of the unit circle is chosen at random. What is the probability that its length is larger than $\sqrt{ 3 }$, the side of the equalateral triangle inscribed in the circle?
Bertrand argued that there are at least three different, but natural ways of generating a random chord:
- Via "random endpoints": choose two random points on the circumference of the circle and draw the chord joining them;

- Via "random radial point": choose a radiius of the circle, choose a point on the radius and construct the chord through this point and perpendicular to the radius;

- Via "random midpoint": choose a point anywhere within the circle and construct a chord with the chosen point as its midpoint

One finds that by doing the calculation, the first method gives a probability of $\frac{1}{2}$, the second of $\frac{1}{3}$ and the third of $\frac{1}{4}$
