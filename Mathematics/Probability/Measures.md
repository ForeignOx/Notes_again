Measure theory is the theory that gives mathematical foundation to the concepts of length, area, and volume. For example, on $\mathbb{R}$, the unique measure that has $\mu(a,b)=b-a$ for intervals $(a,b)$ is the Lebesgue measure 
It was initially created to provided detailed analysis of the notion of length of subsets of the real line, and, more generally, area and volume of subsets of Euclidean spaces
In particular, it provided a systematic answer to the question of which subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ have a length. As was shown by later developments in the set theory, it is actually impossible to assign a length to all subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ in a way which preserves some natural additivity and translation invariance properties
This suggests that picking out a suitable class of measurable subsets is an essential prerequisite
The modern approach to measure is axiomatic. One defines a measure as a map $\mu$ from a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of a set $\Omega$, which satisfies a certain list of properties, similar to those of the [[Probability Spaces|probability space]]
These properties can be shown to hold in many different cases
## Definition
A measure $\mu$ can be defined on any [[Sets|set]] $\Omega$ with a [[Sigma Algebra|$\sigma$-algebra]] of [[Subsets|subsets]] $\mathfrak{F}$, and the defining axioms are versions of the axioms of [[Probabilities|probability]]. The special property of a measure is simply that $\mu(\Omega )=1$
