Informally, a branching process is described as follows:
Let $\left\{ p_{k} \right\}_{k\geq 0}$ be a fixed [[Probabilities|probability]] mass [[functions|function]] in $\mathbb{N}_{0}$. A population starts with a single ancestor who forms generation number $\hspace{0pt}0$
This initial individual splits into $k$ offspring with probability $p_{k}$: the resulting offspring constitute the first generation. Each of the offspring in the fist generation splits independently into a random number of offspring according to the probability mass function $\left\{ p_{k} \right\}$. This process continues until extinction which occurs when all members of a generation fail to produce offspring
This model has a number of applications in biology (eg. it can be thought of as a model of population growth or virus spreading), physics (chain reaction in nuclear fission), queueing theory. Originally it arose from a study of the likelihood of survival of family names
## Definition
Formally, let $\left\{ Z_{n,k} \right\}$, $n\geq 1,k\geq 1$ be a family of [[Independent and Identically Distributed|independent and identically distributed]] [[Random Variables|random variables]] in $\mathbb{N}_{0}$, each having distribution $\left\{ p_{k} \right\}_{k\geq 0}$. Then the branching process $(Z_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ (generated by $\left\{ p_{k} \right\}_{k\geq 0}$) is defined via $Z_{0}=1$, and for $n\geq 1$,
$$
Z_{n}:=Z_{n,1}+Z_{n,2}+\dots+Z_{n,Z_{n-1}}
$$
Where the empty sum is interpreted as zero
Our [[Probability Spaces|probability space]] is defined  by writing
$$
\mathbb{P}(\cdot)\equiv \mathbb{P}_{1}(\cdot)=\mathbb{P}(\cdot|Z_{0}=1)
$$
And our [[Expectation|expectation]] is given by
$$
\mathbb{E}(\cdot)\equiv \mathbb{E}_{1}(\cdot)=\mathbb{E}(\cdot|Z_{0}=1)
$$
If $\varphi_{n}(s)=\mathbb{E}(s^{Z_{n}})$ is the [[Probability Generating Functions|probability generating function]] of $Z_{n}$, a straightforward induction implies
$$
\varphi_{0}(s)\equiv s,~\varphi(s)\equiv \varphi_{1}(s):=\mathbb{E}(s^{Z_{1}})
$$
$$
\varphi_{k}(s)=\varphi_{k-1}(\varphi(s))\equiv \varphi(\varphi_{k-1}(s)),k\geq 1
$$
Usually explicit calculations are hard, but at least in principle, these equations determine the distrubution of $Z_{n}$ for any $n\geq 0$
## Example
Let $\varphi_{1}(s)=\varphi(s)=q+ps$ for some $0<p=1-q<1$, then
$$
\varphi_{n}(s)
$$
