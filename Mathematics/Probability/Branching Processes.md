Informally, a branching process is described as follows:
Let $\left\{ p_{k} \right\}_{k\geq 0}$ be a fixed [[Probabilities|probability]] mass [[functions|function]] in $\mathbb{N}_{0}$. A population starts with a single ancestor who forms generation number $\hspace{0pt}0$
This initial individual splits into $k$ offspring with probability $p_{k}$: the resulting offspring constitute the first generation. Each of the offspring in the fist generation splits independently into a random number of offspring according to the probability mass function $\left\{ p_{k} \right\}$. This process continues until extinction which occurs when all members of a generation fail to produce offspring
This model has a number of applications in biology (eg. it can be thought of as a model of population growth or virus spreading), physics (chain reaction in nuclear fission), queueing theory. Originally it arose from a study of the likelihood of survival of family names
## Definition
Formally, let $\left\{ Z_{n,k} \right\}$, $n\geq 1,k\geq 1$ be a family of [[Independent and Identically Distributed|independent and identically distributed]] [[Random Variables|random variables]] in $\mathbb{N}_{0}$, each having distribution $\left\{ p_{k} \right\}_{k\geq 0}$. Then the branching process $(Z_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ (generated by $\left\{ p_{k} \right\}_{k\geq 0}$) is defined via $Z_{0}=1$, and for $n\geq 1$,
$$
Z_{n}:=Z_{n,1}+Z_{n,2}+\dots+Z_{n,Z_{n-1}}
$$
Where the empty sum is interpreted as zero
Our [[Probability Spaces|probability space]] is defined  by writing
$$
\mathbb{P}(\cdot)\equiv \mathbb{P}_{1}(\cdot)=\mathbb{P}(\cdot|Z_{0}=1)
$$
And our [[Expectation|expectation]] is given by
$$
\mathbb{E}(\cdot)\equiv \mathbb{E}_{1}(\cdot)=\mathbb{E}(\cdot|Z_{0}=1)
$$
If $\varphi_{n}(s)=\mathbb{E}(s^{Z_{n}})$ is the [[Probability Generating Functions|probability generating function]] of $Z_{n}$, a straightforward induction implies
$$
\varphi_{0}(s)\equiv s,~\varphi(s)\equiv \varphi_{1}(s):=\mathbb{E}(s^{Z_{1}})
$$
$$
\varphi_{k}(s)=\varphi_{k-1}(\varphi(s))\equiv \varphi(\varphi_{k-1}(s)),k\geq 1
$$
Usually explicit calculations are hard, but at least in principle, these equations determine the distrubution of $Z_{n}$ for any $n\geq 0$
## Example
Let $\varphi_{1}(s)=\varphi(s)=q+ps$ for some $0<p=1-q<1$, then
$$
\varphi_{n}(s)\equiv q(1+p+\dots+p^{n-1})+p^{n}s=1+p^{n}(s-1)
$$
Notice we have here that $\varphi_{n}(s)\to 1$ as $n\to \infty$ for all $s\in[0,1]$, i.e. the distribution converges to that of $Z_{\infty}\equiv0$ 
Assuming that $\left\{ p_{k} \right\}_{k\geq 0}$ is a non-degenerate distribution, we have $\varphi(1)\equiv \varphi_{1}(1)=1$, and therefore $\varphi_{n}(1)=1$ for all $n\geq 0$
Denote $m:=\varphi'(1_{-})\geq 0$ the average size of offspring of a single individual
A straightforward induction based on our equations shows that
$$
\mathbb{E}(Z_{n})=\frac{d }{ds} \varphi_{n}(s)\Bigg{|}_{s=1_{-}} =m^{n}=(\mathbb{E}(Z_{1}))^{n}
$$
This suggests that if $m\equiv \mathbb{E}(Z)\neq 1$, the branching process might explode (for $m>1$) or die out (for $m<1$)
One classigies branching process into critical (if $m=1$), subcritical $(m<1)$ or supercritical $(m>1)$
It is straightforward to describe the case $m<1$, indeed, [[Markov's Inequality|Markov's inequality]] implies that 
$$
\mathbb{P}(Z_{n}>0)=\mathbb{P}(Z_{n}\geq 1)\leq \mathbb{E}(Z_{n})=m^{n}
$$
So that $\mathbb{P}(Z_{n}>0)\to 0$ as $n\to \infty$ (i.e. [[Convergence in Probability|$Z_{n}\overset{p}\to 0$]])
Moreover, as $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\mathbb{P}(Z_{n}>0)<\infty$, [[Borel-Cantelli Lemma|Borel Cantelli]] implies that $\mathbb{P}(Z_{n}\to 0)=1$ i.e. [[Almost Sure Convergence|$Z_{n}\overset{a.s.}\to 0$]]
We also notice that the average total population in this case is finite,
$$
\mathbb{E}\left( \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}Z_{n} \right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}m^{n}=\frac{1}{1-m}<\infty
$$
## Definition
The extinction [[Events|event]] $\mathcal{E}$ is the event
$$
\mathcal{E}=\bigcup \left\{ Z_{n}=0 \right\}
$$
As $\left\{ z_{n}=0 \right\}\subset \left\{ Z_{n+1}=0 \right\}$ for all $n\geq 0$, the extinction probability $\rho$ is defined as
$$
\rho=\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})=\lim_{ n \to \infty } \mathbb{P}(Z_{n}=0)
$$
Where $\mathbb{P}(Z_{n}=0)=\varphi_{n}(0)$ is the extinction probability before $(n+1)$st generation
___
The following result helps to derive the extinction probability $\rho$ without need to compute iterates $\varphi_{n}(\cdot)$
To avoid trivialities, we assume that $p_{0}=\mathbb{P}(Z=0)$ satisfies $0<p_{0}<1$, under this assumption $\varphi(s)$ is a strictly increasing function of $s \in[0,1]$
## Theorem
If $0<p_{0}<1$, then the extinction probability $\rho$ is given by the smallest positive solution to the equation 
$$
s=\varphi(s)
$$
In particular, if $m=\mathbb{E}(Z)\leq 1$, then $\rho=1$; otherwise, we have $0<\rho<1$
## Remark
The relation $\rho=\varphi(\rho)$ has a clear probabilistic sense. Indeed, if $\rho=\mathbb{P}_{1}(\mathcal{E})$
