## Definition
Let $\Omega$ be a [[Sets|set]] and let $\mathfrak{F}$ be a [[Sigma Algebra|$\sigma$-field]] of [[Subsets|subsets]] of $\Omega$, i.e. a [[Measurable Spaces|measurable space]], then a function $f:\Omega\to \mathbb{R}$ is called measurable if the [[Image|pre-image]] of any closed [[Intervals|interval]] $[a,b]\subset \mathbb{R}$ is in $\mathfrak{F}$, i.e. all $f^{-1}([a,b])\in\mathfrak{F}$
## Properties
The set of measurable functions is naturally closed under algebraic operations
In addition (and more importantly) this class is closed under various kinds of point-wise sequential limits, for example if the sequence $\left\{ f_{k} \right\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$ consists of measurable functions, then both

\liminf_{ n \to \infty } f_{k}\text{ and }\limsup_{ n \to \infty } f_{k}

Are measurable functions
