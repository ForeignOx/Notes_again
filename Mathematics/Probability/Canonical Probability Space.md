In the uncountable case of [[Sample Spaces|$\Omega=[0,1]$]], it is tempting to start with the collection $\mathcal{D}$ of all intervals $(a,b]$ with $0\leq a<b\leq 1$ and to define 
$$
\mathbb{P}((a,b]):=b-a
$$
The length of $(a,b]$
We can uniquely define a [[Sigma Algebra|sigma algebra]] generated by $\mathcal{D}$, it is known as the Borel $\sigma$-field $\mathcal{B}[0,1]$
An important result in real analysis claims that the length measure $\mathbb{P}(\cdot)$ uniquely extends to a probability measure known as the Lebesgue measure in $[0,1]$
## Definition
The canonical [[Probability Spaces|probability space]] is the triple $([0,1],\mathcal{B}[0,1],\mathbb{P})$, where $\mathcal{B}[0,1]$ is the Borel $\sigma$-algebra in $[0,1]$ and $\mathbb{P}$ is the Lebesgue measure in $[0,1]$
## Remark
One can similarly define the Borel $\sigma$-algebra for other subsets $\mathcal{X}$ of $\mathbb{R}$ (including the positive half-line or the whole of $\mathbb{R}$)
The length measure then uniquely extends to the Lebesgue measure on $\mathcal{X}$ (of course, in general, one doesn't expect the probabilistic normalisation $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{X})=1$) 
Generalisations to higher dimensions are also possible
## Remark
The Borel $\sigma$-algebra is arguably, the most natural $\sigma$-algevra in $[0,1]$. It is generated by many collections of subsets of $[0,1]$.
