A domain $D$ of a [[Sets|set]] is an [[Open Sets|open]], [[Connectedness|connected]] subet of $\mathbb{C}$. Some peple call comains regions and sets domsins, so be careful loll

The geometry of $\mathbb{C}$ provides:
## Theorem
Any domain in $\mathbb{C}$ is piecewise $C^{1}$ connected
## Examples
- Open balls are domains, closed balls are not open so aren't domains
- $\mathbb{C}\setminus \mathbb{R}_{\leq 0}$ i.e. the principle branch of the [[Logarithms|logarithm]], consequently any branch is defined on a domain
- The set $A=\left\{ z\in \mathbb{C}\middle| \left| z\neq 1 \right| \right\}$ i not a domain (it is open, but not connected)
