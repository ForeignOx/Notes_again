## Definition
A [[Sets|set]] $A\subseteq \mathbb{C}$ is said to be path connected if for any two points $z,w\in A$ there exists a [[Curves|path]] $\gamma$ that starts at $z$ and ends at $w$ such that $\gamma(t)\in A$ for all $t\in[0,1]$ (i.e. the path's [[Image|image]] lies entirely inside $A$)
## Theorem
If $A\subseteq \mathbb{C}$ is path connected, then it is connected
### Remark
The converse is not true in general, there are connected sets that are not path connected
