## Definition
A [[Sets|set]] $A\subseteq \mathbb{C}$ is said to be connected if $A\subseteq U_{1}\cup U_{2}$ for some [[Open Sets|open sets]] $U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$ such that $U_{1}\cap U_{2}=\emptyset$ implies that $A\subseteq U_{1}$ or $A\subseteq U_{2}$
In other words, we can't separate $A$  into two non-empty parts which lie intwo disjoint open sets

Connectedness can be hard to show, but intuitively, if we can find a nice "path" between any two points in the set, we think that this will imply connectedness
