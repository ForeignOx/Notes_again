## Definition
A [[Domains|domain]] $D$  is called starlike if there exists a point $a_{0}\in D$ such that for all $b\in D$ different to $a_{0}$, the line joining $a_{0}$ with $b$ lies in $D$
## Example
The whole of [[Complex Numbers|$\mathbb{C}$]] is trivially a starlike domain; we can take any point in $\mathbb{C}$ as $a_{0}$ e.g. the origin
___
Any open ball $B_{r}(a)\subseteq \mathbb{C}$ is starlike
