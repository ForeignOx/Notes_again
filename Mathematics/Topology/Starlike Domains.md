## Definition
A [[Domains|domain]] $D$  is called starlike if there exists a point $a_{0}\in D$ such that for all $b\in D$ different to $a_{0}$, the line joining $a_{0}$ with $b$ lies in $D$
## Examples
The whole of [[Complex Numbers|$\mathbb{C}$]] is trivially a starlike domain; we can take any point in $\mathbb{C}$ as $a_{0}$ e.g. the origin
___
Any [[open sets|open ball]] $B_{r}(a)\subseteq \mathbb{C}$ is starlike; we may take $a_{0}=a$, the centre of the ball
___
One can check that the set $\mathbb{C}\setminus \mathbb{R}_{\leq 0}$ on which the principle branch of the [[Logarithms|logarithm]] is [[Continuity|continuous]] is a starlike domain by picking some $a_{0}\in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$
___
It is easy to see that any convex, open, connected subset of $\mathbb{C}$ is a starlike domain,
