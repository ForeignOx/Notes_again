## Definition
A [[Domains|domain]] $D$  is called starlike if there exists a point $a_{0}\in D$ such that for all $b\in D$ different to $a_{0}$, the line joining $a_{0}$ with $b$ lies in $D$
## Example
The whole of $\mathbb{C}$ is trivially a starlike domain; we can take any point in $\mathbb{C}$ as $$
