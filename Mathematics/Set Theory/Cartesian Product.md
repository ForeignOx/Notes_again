## Definition
The cartesian product of two [[Sets|sets]] $X,Y$ is given by:
$$
X\times Y=\{ (x,y)|x\in X,y\in Y \}
$$
Where $(x,y)$ is an [[Ordered Pairs|ordered pair]] of elements in each set
We argue that in a special case, that the cartesian product $X\times Y\times Z$ is the set of all ordered triples $\underline{x}=(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})$, such that $x_{1}\in X,x_{2}\in Y,x_{3}\in Z$, more generally,
$$
X_{1}\times X_{2}\times\dots X_{n}=\prod_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}
$$
Is the set of ordered $n$-tuples $\underline{x}=(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})$ such that $x_{i}\in X_{i}$ for $i=1,\dots ,n$
If we interpret an ordere $n$-tuple as a function on $\overline{n}=\left\{ 1,\dots,n \right\}$, we have that $\prod_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}$ is the set of all [[Functions|functions]] $\underline{x}$ with domain $\overline{n}$ such that $x_{i}\in X_{i}$ for all $i\in \overline{n}$
We can generalise this definition to the Cartesian product of an arbitrary indexed collection of sets:
The Cartesian product $\prod_{i\in I}S_{i}$ of the [[Sets of Indices|indexed collection of sets]] $\left\{ S_{i}\mid i\in I \right\}$ is the set of all function $f$ with [[Domain|domain]] the index set $I$ such that $f(i)\in S_{i}$ for all $i\in I$
We can also use the notation $\prod\left\{ S_{i}\mid i\in I \right\}$ for the product and $f_{i}$ for the value $f(i)$

Let $X$ and $Y$ be finite sets, then $|X\times Y|=|X||Y|$, and hence $|X^{n}|=|X|^{n}$
A [[Relations|relation]] $R$ is always a subset of [[Range|$R\times \text{range}(R)$]]
