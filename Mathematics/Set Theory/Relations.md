The notion of a correspondence, or relation, and the special case of a mapping, or [[Functions|function]], is fundamental to mathematics. A correspondence is a pairing of objects such that given any two objects $x$ and $y$, the [[Ordered Pairs|pair]] $(x,y)$ either does or does not correspond
A particular correspondence or relation is generally presented by a [[Proposition|statement frame]] $P(x,y)$ having two variables, with $x$ and $y$ corresponding if and only if $P(x,y)$ is true
Given any relation, the set of all ordered pairs $(x,y)$ of corresponding elements is called its graph
A relation is a mathematical object, and so it is a [[Sets|set]]. Since the graph of a relation is a set of ordered pairs, it is efficient and customary to take the graph to be the relation. Thus a relation is simply a set of ordered pairs
If $R$ is a relation, then we say that $x$ has the relation $R$ to $y$, and we write $xRy$ iff $(x,y)\in R$. We also say $x$ corresponds to $y$ under $R$.

The set of all first elements occurring in the ordered pairs of a relation $R$ is the [[Domain|domain]] of $R$, and the set of second elements the [[Range|range]]
A statement frame $P(x,y)$ having two free variables determines a pair of mutually [[Inverses#Relations|inverse]] relations $R$ and $S$, called the graphs of $P$, as follows:
$$
R=\left\{ (x,y)\mid P(x,y) \right\},S= \left\{ (y,x)\mid P(x,y) \right\}
$$
A two-variable frame together with a choice of which variable is considered to be first might be called a directed frame. Then a directed frame would have a uniquely determined relation for its graph. For example the relation of strict strict inequality on the [[Real Numbers|real numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$ would be considered the set $\left\{ (x,y)\mid x<y \right\}$, since the variables in $x<y$ have a natural order
A relation $R$ is always a subset of [[Range|$R\times \text{range}(R)$]]
