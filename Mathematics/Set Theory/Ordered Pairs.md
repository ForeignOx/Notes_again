## Definition
Given two objects $a,b$, there is an obect $(a,b)$ called the ordered pair of $a$ and $b$ (the order matters). We require $(a_{1},b_{1})=(a_{2},b_{2})\iff a_{1}=a_{2},b_{1}=b_{2}$
## Ordered Triples
The ordered triple $(x,y,z)$ is usually defined to be the ordered pair $((x,y),z)$
The reason for this definition is probably that a [[Functions|function]] of two variables $x$ and $y$ is ordinarily considered a function of the single ordered air variable $(x,y)$, so that, for example, a real-valued function of two real variables is a subset of $(\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R})\times \mathbb{R}$. But we also consider such a function a subset of Cartesian 3-space, $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Therefore we define $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ as $(\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R})\times \mathbb{R}$
On the other hand, the ordered triple $(x,y,z)$ could also be regarded as the finite sequence $\left\{ (1,x),(2,y),(3,z) \right\}$, which, of course, is a different object. These two models seerve equally well, and mathematicians tend to slur over the distinction; They treat $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and [[Product Sets|$\mathbb{R}^{\overline{3}}$]] to be equal
## More Ordered Numbers
Similarly, we pretend that Cartesian 4-space $\mathbb{R}^{4}$ is $\mathbb{R}^{\overline{4}}$, $\mathbb{R}^{2}\times \mathbb{R}^{2}$, or $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}^{3}$ etc.
Clearly, we are in effect assuming an associative law for ordered pair formation that we don't really have :/
