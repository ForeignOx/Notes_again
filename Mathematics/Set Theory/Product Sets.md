## Definition
The [[Sets|set]] of all [[Functions|functions]] from $A$ to $S$ is designated $S^{A}$
## Examples
Thus $\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{R}}$ is the set of all real-valued functions of one real variable, and $S^{\mathbb{Z}^{+}}$ is the set of all infinite [[Sequences|sequences]] in $S$ (it is undeerstood that an infinite sequence is nothing but a function whose domain is the set $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ of all positive integers.)
Similarly, if we set $\overline{n}=\left\{ 1,\dots,n \right\}$, then $S^{\overline{n}}$ is the set of all finite sequences of length $n$ in $S$.
