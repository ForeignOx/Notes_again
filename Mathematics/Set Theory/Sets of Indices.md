## Definition
An indexed collection, as a [[Sets|set]], is nothing but the [[Range|range]] set of a [[Functions|function]], the indexing function, and a particular indexed object, say $x_{i}$, is simply athe value of that function at the [[Domain|domain]] element $i$
If the set of indices is $I$, the indexed set is designated $\left\{ x_{i}\mid i\in I \right\}$, or $\left\{ x_{i} \right\}_{i\in I}$ (or $\left\{ x_{i} \right\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$in the case that $I=\mathbb{N}$)
## Remark
This notation suggests that we view the indexed set as being obtained by letting the index run through the index set $I$ and collecting the indexed object. That is, an indexed set is viewed as being the set together with the indexing function. This ambivalence is reflected in the fact that the same notation frequently designates the mapping, thus we refer to the [[Sequences|sequence]] $\left\{ x_{i} \right\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$, where, of course, the sequence is the mapping $n\mapsto x_{n}$
Because set theory cannot reflect these nuances in any simple and graceful way, we shall take an indexed set to be the indexing function
The same [[Range|range]] can be obtained with different indices, there is no impllication that indexing is [[Bijective Functions|bijective]]
Note also that indexing imposes no restriction on the set being indexed; any set can at least be self-indexed (by the identity function $f(x)=x$)
Except for the ambiguous $\left\{ x_{i}\mid i\in I \right\}$, there is no universally used notation for the indexing function. Since $x_{i}$ is the value of the function at $i$, we might think of it as another way of writing $x(i)$, in which case we designate the function '$x$'. We certianly do this in the case of ordere $n$-tuplets, such as $\underline{x}=(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n})$. We can however call the indexing function whatever we want, if it is $f$, then of course $f(i)=x_{i}$ for all $i$
