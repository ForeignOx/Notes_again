## Relations
The set of all second elements occurring in the [[Ordered Pairs|ordered pairs]] of a [[Relations|relation]] $R$ is called the range of $R$:
$$
\text{Ran}(R)=\left\{ y\mid(\exists x)(x,y)\in  R \right\}
$$
## Functions
The range of a [[Functions|function]] $f$ is the [[Sets|set]] of all images of $f$. This is a [[Subsets|subset]] of the codomain
We can write this as:
$$
\text{Ran}f=\{ f(x)|x\in \text{Dom}f \}\subseteq \text{Codom}f
$$
