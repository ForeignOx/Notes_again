A [[Functions|function]]
$$
f:D\to C

is bijective if it is both [[Injective Functions|injective]] and [[Surjective Functions|surjective]], this is a good place to use the term "one to one"

Let $\mathfrak{B}(A)$ be the [[Sets|set]] of all bijections $f:A\to A$. Then $\mathfrak{B}(A)$ is closed under [[Composition of Functions|composition]] and
- $f\circ(g\circ h)=(f\circ g)\circ h$ for all $f,g,h \in \mathfrak{B}$
- there exists a unique [[Identity Map|$I\in \mathfrak{B}(A)$]] such that $f\circ I=I\circ f=f$ for all $f\in \mathfrak{B}$
- for each $f\in\mathfrak{B}$ there exists a unique $g\in \mathfrak{B}$ such that $f\circ g=g\circ f=I$
Hence $\mathfrak{B}(A)$ is a [[Groups|group]] under composition
