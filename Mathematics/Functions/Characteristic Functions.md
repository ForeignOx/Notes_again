## Definition
If $B$ is a [[Subsets|subset]] of the [[Sets|set]] $S$, then its characteristic [[Functions|function]] (relative to $S$) is the function on $S$, usually designated $\chi_{B}$ which has constant value $1$ on $B$, and $0$ off $B$
The set of all characteristic functions of subsets of $S$ is thus $2^{S}$ (since $2=\left\{ 0,1 \right\}$)
Because this collection of functions is in a natural [[Bijective Functions|bijective]] correspondence with the collection of all subsets of $S$, we tend to identify the two collections, thus $2^{S}$ is also interpreted as the [[Power Sets|power set]] of $S$
