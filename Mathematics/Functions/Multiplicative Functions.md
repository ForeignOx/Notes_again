A [[Functions|function]] $f:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{C}$ with the property that $f(1)=1$ and $f(mn)=f(m)f(n)$ whenever $m$ and $n$ are coprime is called a multiplicative function. Examples include the Euler totient function and the Mobius function.
A result of Paul Erdos shows that any [[Monotonic Functions|increasing]] multiplicative function that is not constant is of the form
$$
f(n)=n^{\alpha}
$$
For some $\alpha>0$
