We can think of [[Linear Differential Operators|linear differential operators]] as similar to matrix equations:
$$
A\underline{x}=\underline{b}
$$
Which has solution
$$
\underline{x}=A^{-1}\underline{b}
$$
But here we have
$$
\mathcal{L}y=f
$$
Which has solution
$$
y=\int ^{b}_{a} g(x,t)f(t) \, dt 
$$
Which we see in [[Green's Method|Green's method]]
