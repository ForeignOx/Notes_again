Let $A$ and $B$ be [[Proposition|propositions]], we saty "$A$ is equivalent to $B$" for the statement [[Implication|$A\implies B$]] [[And|and]] $B\implies A$. We write this as $A\iff B$ 
$$
A\iff B=(A\cap B)\cup(A'\cap B')
$$

| $A$ | $B$ | $A\iff B$ |
| --- | --- | --------- |
| T   | T   | T         |
| T   | F   | F         |
| F   | T   | F         |
| F   | F   | T         |
Important equivalences using [[And|and]], [[Or|or]], [[Not|not]], and implication include
$$
A \iff (A')'
$$
$$
 (P\cup Q)'=P'\cap Q'
$$
$$
 P\implies Q \iff Q\cup P'
$$
$$
 (P\implies Q)' \iff P\cap Q'
$$
