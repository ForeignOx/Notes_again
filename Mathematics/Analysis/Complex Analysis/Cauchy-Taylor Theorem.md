## Theorem
Let [[Complex Functions|$f:U\to \mathbb{C}$]] be [[Holomorphicity|holomorphic]] on some ball $B_{r}(a)$ then $f$ can be represented by a [[power series|power series]], which we call the [[Taylor Series|Taylor series]] of $f$ at point  on $B_{r}(a)$:
$$
f(w)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_{n}(a-a)^{n}
$$
In particular, $f$ is infinitely many times complex [[Differentiation|differentiable]] at $a$ and
$$
c_{n}= \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int _{\left| z-a \right| =\rho} \frac{f(z)}{(z-a)^{n+1}}\, dz 
$$
For any $0<\rho<r$
