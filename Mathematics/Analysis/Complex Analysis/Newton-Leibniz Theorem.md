## Theorem: Closed Contour Case
Let $f:U\to \mathbb{C}$ be a continuous function on an open set $U\subset \mathbb{C}$, if $f$ has a [[Holomorphicity|holomorphic]] antiderivative $F$ on $U$
Then
$$
\int _{\gamma}f(z) \, dz=0 
$$
For all closed contours $\gamma \subset U$
## Remark
Finding antiderivatives is not a trivial thing, and this is our main restriction
## Example
For $r>0$ we have for any $a\in \mathbb{C}$,
$$
\int _{\left| z-a \right| =r}(z-a)^{n} \, dz =\begin{cases}
0 & n\neq -1
\end{cases} 
$$
