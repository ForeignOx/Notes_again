Circles are a set of points equidistance from a central point, they are useful in many situations

## Equation of Circles in $\mathbb{C}$
The equation of a general circle in the [[Complex Numbers|complex]] plane is given by
$$
\left| z-a \right| =r
$$
Where $r>0$ is the radius, and $a\in\mathbb{C}$ is the centre
___
Given $\gamma,\beta \in\mathbb{R}$ and $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$, the equation
$$
\gamma z \overline{z}-\overline{\alpha}z-\alpha \overline{z}+\beta=0
$$
Describes a circle if $\gamma \neq 0$ and $\left| \alpha \right|^{2}-\beta\gamma>0$, and any circle can be described by an equation of this form
### Proof
The equation of a general circle we know is given by
$$
\left| z-a \right| =r
$$
For some $a\in\mathbb{C}$ and  $r>0$. This can be written equivalently as
$$
(z-a)(\overline{z}-\overline{a})=r^{2} 
$$
$$
 z\overline{z}-
$$
