## Definition
Given $\hspace{0pt}4$ distinct points $z_{0},z_{1},z_{2},z_{3}\in\mathbb{C}$, the cross-ratio of these points, denoted by $(z_{0},z_{1};z_{2},z_{3})$ is defined by
$$
(z_{0},z_{1};z_{2},z_{3})=\frac{(z_{0}-z_{2})(z_{1}-z_{3})}{(z_{0}-z_{3})(z_{1}-z_{2})}= \frac{\frac{z_{0}-z_{2}}{z_{0}-z_{3}}}{\frac{z_{1}-z_{2}}{z_{1}-z_{3}}}
$$
The cross ratio can be extended to [[Riemann Sphere|$\hat{\mathbb{C}}$]] with the convention that if one of the points is $\infty$, we remove all the terms that involve that point, for example,
$$
(\infty,z_{1};z_{2},z_{3}):= \frac{z_{1}-z_{3}}{z_{1}-z_{2}}
$$
