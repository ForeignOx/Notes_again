## Definition
For a fixed $\theta$ (which we usually take in the range o fangles we consider) the ray of angle $\theta$ is the set
$$
\left\{ z\in  \mathbb{C}\setminus \left\{ 0 \right\}:\middle|:  \mathrm{Arg}(z)=\theta\right\}
$$
The closed ray is the angle together with the origin:
$$
\left\{ z\in  \mathbb{C}\setminus \left\{ 0 \right\}:\middle|:  \mathrm{Arg}(z)=\theta\right\}\cup \left\{ 0 \right\}
$$
