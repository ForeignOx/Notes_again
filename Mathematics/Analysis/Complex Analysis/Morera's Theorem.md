## Theorem
Let [[Complex Functions|$f$]] be [[Continuity|continuous]] on a [[Domains|domain]] $D$, if $\int _{\gamma }f(z) \, dz=0$ for every closed contour $\gamma$, then $f$ is [[Holomorphicity|holomorphic]] on $D$
### Proof
By the [[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus|fundamental theorem of calculus]], there exists a holomorphic [[Integration|antiderivative]] $F$. By The corollary $F$ has a holomorphic derivative (since holomorphic iff analytic) and $F'=f$
