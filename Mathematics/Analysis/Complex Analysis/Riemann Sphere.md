There is a beautiful geometric way to imagine $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and the [[Complex Numbers|complex plane]] as a part of a sphere known as the Reimann sphere
Consider the unit sphere
$$
\mathbb{S}^{2}:= \left\{ (\xi,\eta,\zeta)\in \mathbb{R}^{3}:\middle|: \xi^{2}+\eta^{2}+\zeta^{2}=1 \right\}
$$
In $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and consider a copy of $\mathbb{C}$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ by identifying $\mathbb{C}=\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with the $xy$-plane which corresponds to the point $(x,y,0)\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
Let $N=(0,0,1)\in\mathbb{S}^{2}$ denote the north pole
For any point $v\in \mathbb{S}^{2}\setminus \left\{ N \right\}$, there is a unique straight line $L_{n,v}$ passing through $N$ and $v$. Since $v\neq N$, this line is not parallel to the $xy$-plane and as such, it intersects in it a unique point $(x,y,0)$
We have defined a [[Functions|map]] $P:\mathbb{S}^{2}\setminus \left\{ N \right\}\to \mathbb{C}$ by $P(\xi,\eta,\zeta)=x+iy$. The map $P$ is  called the stereographic projection (from the north pole)

One beautiful consequence of the Riemann Sphere is that we can identify an 'infinity in the complex plane, which corresponds to the north pole. This, in terms of the complex plane is an infinite circle $\left| z \right|=\infty$
Consequently we can extend our complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ to 
$$
\hat{\mathbb{C}}:=\mathbb{C}\cup \left\{ \infty \right\}
$$
Where infinity is understood as a circle of infinite radius or the north pole of the Reimann sphere
