These are useful to find [[Domains|domains]] that are [[Holomorphicity|holomorphically]] equivalent
## Definition
Let $D$ and $D'$ be domains. We say that a [[functions|function]] $f:D\to D'$ is biholomorphic if $f$ is holomorphic, a [[Bijective Functions|bijection]], and the [[Inverses|inverse]] $f^{-1}:D'\to D$ is also holomorphic
A biholomorphic map $f$ is called a biholomorphism. When $f$ as above exists, we say that the domains $D$ and $D'$ are biholomorphic and write $f:D \tilde{\to} D'$
## Remark
It is possible to prove that if $f$ as above is holomorphic and bijective then it is automatic that its inverse is holomorphic
## Example
The map $f(z)=az+b$ is biholomorphic between $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{C}$ if $a\neq 0$, in that case, its inverse is 
$$
f^{-1}(z)=\frac{z-b}{a}
$$
___
$f(z)=e^{ z }$ is not biholomorphic from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{C}^{*}$ as it is not injective. It is, however, a biholomorphism between $\left\{ z\in\mathbb{C}se| \right\}$
