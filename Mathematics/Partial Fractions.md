## Proposition
Let $f(x)=\frac{g(x)}{h(x)}$ be a [[Functions|function]] that is the ratio of two [[Polynomials|polynomials]], without common roots. Let $\deg(g)<\deg(h)=m$ and suppose that the roots $a_{1},\dots,a_{m}$ of $h(x)$ are all distinct. Then $f(x)$ can be decomposed into a sum of partial fractions, i.e. for some constants $b_{1},b_{2},\dots,b_{m}$,
$$
f(x)=\frac{b_{1}}{a_{1}-x}+\frac{b_{2}}{a_{2}-x}+\dots+\frac{b_{m}}{a_{m}-x}
$$
