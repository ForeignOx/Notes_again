## Definition
The representation of [[Phase Spaces|phase space]] in terms of equilibrium points and [[State Trajectories|state trajectories]]  is known as the phase portrait of the system
## Example
Consider a pendulum, its Lagrangian is given by
$$
L=\frac{1}{2}m\ell^{2}\dot{\theta}^{2}+mg\ell \cos\theta
$$
So the [[Hamiltonian|Hamiltonian]] is 
$$
H=\frac{1}{2m\ell^{2}}p_{\theta}
$$
