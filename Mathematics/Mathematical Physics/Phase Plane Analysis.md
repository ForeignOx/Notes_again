The [[Hamiltonian|Hamiltonian]] analogue to [[Normal Modes|normal mode]] techniques is phase plane analysis and helps develop intuition for the behavior of dynamic systems
This generalises to arbitrary numbers of dimensions, but to aid visualisation, we'll consider systems with $\hspace{0pt}1$ degree of freedom where [[Phase Spaces|phase space]] is 2-dimensional and can be parametrised by a single coordinate $q$ with associated [[Generalised Momentum|generalised momentum]] $p$.
Recall that each point in space fully specifies all the data needed to determine the time evolution of the system. So if we know that at time $t=t_{0}$ the system is at $(q(t_{0}),p(t_{0}))$ in phase space, then we can fully determine the values of $(q(t),p(t))$ for all $t$
