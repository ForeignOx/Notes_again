Magnetostatics are determined by setting 
$$
\frac{ \partial \underline{E} }{ \partial t }=\frac{ \partial \underline{B} }{ \partial t }=0
$$
Which, when plugged into Maxwell's Equations, gives
$$
\underline{\nabla} \cdot \underline{B} =0
$$
$$
\underline{\nabla} \times \underline{E} =\mu \underline{J}
$$
These two equations fully determine the field of magnetostatics.
Since we have time independence, [[Electric Fields|$\underline{E}$]] and [[Magnetic Fields|$\underline{B}$]] are actualy independent entities
Both of the systems of [[Electrostatics|electrostatics]] and magnetostatics are of the form
$$
\underline{\nabla} \cdot \underline{F} =D
$$
$$
 \underline{\nabla} \times \underline{F} =\underline{C}
$$
If we take the second and take the divergence of both sides
$$
0=\underline{\nabla} \cdot (\underline{\nabla} \times \underline{F} )=\underline{\nabla} \cdot \underline{ E}  
$$
By definitions of [[Divergence and Curl|divergence and curl]], so the divergence of $\underline{J}$ must be zero
One question we are interested is whether these equations are enough to completely fix $\underline{F}$?
Given a solution to $\underline{f}_{0}$ we
