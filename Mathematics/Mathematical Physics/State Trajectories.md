## Definition
Each point in space fully specifies all the data needed to determine the time evolution of the system. So if we know that at time $t=t_{0}$ the system is at $(q(t_{0}),p(t_{0}))$ in phase space, then we can fully determine the values of $(q(t),p(t))$ for all $t$
We can trace the set of such points in [[Phase Spaces|phase space]] for $t$ going from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ and generically it will give us a curve in phase space known as a [[states|state]] trajectory. We say generically, since there is a possible exception: consider a point $(q_{0},p_{0})$ such that
$$
\frac{ \partial H }{ \partial q } \Bigg{|}_{(q_{0},p_{0})} =\frac{ \partial H }{ \partial p } \Bigg{|}_{(q_{0},p_{0})} =0
$$
Then [[Hamiltonian|Hamilton]]'s equations of motion then imply that $\dot{q}=\dot{p}=0$ and therefore $q(t)=q_{0}$ and $p(t)=p_{0}$ for all $t$
We refer to such points as equilibrium points
