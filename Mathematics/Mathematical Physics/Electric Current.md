In general we have that electric [[Electric Current|current]] is generated by movement of [[Electric Charge|electric charge]] from one place to another
Given a surface $S$, it is meaningful to talk about the rate at which the charge flows through $S$. For this reason we define the electric current density $\underline{J}$
The total current through a surface $S$, is
$$
I_{S}(t)=\int _{S}\underline{J}(t,\underline{x})\cdot \, d \underline{S} 
$$

___
The electric current, $I$, through a [[Electrical Conductors|conductor]] is the rate of flow of [[Electric Charge|charge]]
$$
I=\frac{dQ}{dt}
$$
It is the charge passing per unit time through a cross-section of the conductor. Electric current is measured in amperes (A), which have a unit of $\pu{Cs-1  }$
Suppose the mean [[Drift Velocity]] of free electrons in a wire is $v$. Then all the free electrons in a length $v\Delta t$ of conductor will pass through a cross section of the wire $A$ in a time $\Delta t$
![[Electric Current 2024-03-04 21.40.29.excalidraw]]

The number of free electrons in that piece of wire can be calculated using the volume, which is $Av\Delta t$, so the number of free electrons is $nAv\Delta t$, where $n$ is the free electron concentration, the number of free electrons per unit volume of the metal
As each electron has charge $-e$, the charge passing through a cross-section in time $\Delta t$ is $\Delta Q=-nAv\Delta te$, so current is:
$$
I=nAve
$$
The reason this is not negative is because conventional current flows in the opposite direction to free electrons
## Current of a power supply
We can use the [[Internal Resistance]] relationship and $V=IR$ to work out the current of a power supply:
$$
V=E-Ir
$$
$$
\implies IR=E-Ir
$$
$$
\implies I= \frac{E}{R+r}
$$
