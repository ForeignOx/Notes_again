Electrostatics are determined by setting 
$$
\frac{ \partial \underline{E} }{ \partial t }=\frac{ \partial \underline{B} }{ \partial t }=0
$$
Which, when plugged into Maxwell's Equations, gives
$$
\underline{\nabla} \cdot \underline{E} =\frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_{0}}
$$
$$
 \underline{\nabla} \times \underline{E} =0
$$
These two equations fully determine the field of electrostatics.
Since we have time independence, [[Electric Fields|$\underline{E}$]] and [[Magnetic Fields|$\underline{B}$]] are actualy independent entities
Both of the systems of electrostatics and magnetostatics are of the form
$$
\underline{\nabla} \cdot \underline{F} =D
$$
$$
 \underline{\nabla} \times \underline{F} =\underline{C}
$$
If we take the second and take the divergence of both sides
$$
0=\underline{\nabla} \cdot (\underline{\nabla} \times \underline{F} )=\underline{\nabla} \cdot \underline{ C}  
$$
By definitions of [[Divergence and Curl|divergence and curl]], this is trivial for $\underline{E}$
