## Definition
Consider an infinitesimally small volume element $\delta V$ centred at some position $\underline{x}$ small enough for $\underline{v}(t,\underline{x})$ to be approximately constant throughout the volume
We can think  that $\underline{v}(t,\underline{x})$ gives the average velocity of constituent particles inside $\delta V$ at time $t$
## Example
If we have a charged fluid with [[Electric Charge|charge]] density $\rho(t,\underline{x})$ and fluid velocity $\underline{v}(t,\underline{x})$, then the [[Electric Current|current]] density $\underline{J}(t,\underline{x})=\rho(t,\underline{x})\underline{v}(t,\underline{x})$
