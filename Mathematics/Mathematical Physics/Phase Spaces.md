## Definition
The phase (or state) space $\mathscr{P}$ is the space of all possible [[States|states]] for a classical system
## Remark
The dimension of the phase space is twice the dimension of the [[Configuration Spaces|configuration space]],
$$
\dim(\mathscr{P})=2\dim(C)
$$
## Example
A particle moving in $\hspace{0pt}1$ dimension has $C=\mathbb{R}$, and hence $\mathscr{P}=\mathbb{R}^{2}$
