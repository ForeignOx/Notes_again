## Definition
Consider a uniparametric family of smooth [[Functions|maps]] $\phi(\varepsilon):C\to C$, where $C$ is our [[Configuration Spaces|configuration space]] such that $\phi(0)=\text{identity}$
We call this family of maps a transformation depending on $\varepsilon$ 
In any given coordinate system for $C$, we write the transformation as $q_{i}\to \phi_{i}(\underline{q},\varepsilon)$
Whenever the transformation is clear from context, we also write $q_{i}\to q_{i}'$
We take the velocities $\dot{q}_{i}$ ot transform as $\dot{q}_{i}\to \frac{d \phi_{i}}{dt}$
