## Definition
The state of a classical system in time is a complete set of data that fully specifies future evolution
## Example
If $L=L(\underline{q},\underline{\dot{q}})$ is the [[Euler-Lagrange Equations|Euler-Lagrange]] equations are $N$ [[Second Order Ordinary Differential Equations|second order differential equations]], and a state can be given by specifying $\underline{q}(t_{0}),\underline{\dot{q}}(t_{0})$
Importatnly, this is not the only parametrisation
