## Definition
Charge $q$ is a real number we can associate to point particles. In [[SI units|SI units]], it is measured in Coulombs ($\pu{C}$)
An electron has charge $q=-e$ with $e=1.6\times 10^{-19}\pu{C}$
Quarks have $q=-\frac{e}{3}$ or $q=\frac{2e}{3}$
To study continuous distributions of charge, we can introduce a charge density $\rho(t,\underline{x})$
The total charge inside $V$ is
$$
Q_{V}(t)=\int _{V} \rho(t,\underline{x}) \, dV=\int _{V}\rho(t,\underline{x}) \, d^{3}\underline{x}  
$$
