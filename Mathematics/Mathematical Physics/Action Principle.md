## Principle
For arbitrary smooth small deformations $\delta x(t)$ around the true path $x(t)$, we have:
$$
\delta S:= S[x+\delta x]-S[x]=\mathcal{O}((\delta x)^{2})
$$
In other words:
It is possible to choose an action [[Functionals|functional]] $S[x(t)]$ such that the paths desribed by physical particles are stationary paths of $S$
___
For nice systems it will be the case that $S$ can be expressed as the time integral of a Lagrangian. That is, we have
$$
S[x]=\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} L(x(t),\dot{x}(t)) \, dt 
$$
For some [[Functions|function]] $L(a,b)$ of two real variables
