If we consider a point charge $Q$ sitting at the origin. Symmetry suggests that $\underline{E}(\underline{r})=E(\left| \underline{r} \right|)\underline{e}_{r}$, and we denote $r=\left| \underline{r} \right|$,
So we need to fix $E(\left| \underline{r} \right|)$. Note that $\underline{\nabla} \times \underline{E}=0$ by Maxwell's equations, so by [[Gauss' Law|Gauss' law]], considering a sphere with surface $S_{r}$
$$
\int _{S_{r}}\underline{E}\cdot \, d \underline{S} =\frac{Q_{V}}{\varepsilon_{0}}=\frac{Q}{\varepsilon_{0}}
$$
Computing the integral
$$
\int _{S_{r}}E(r)\underline{e}_{r}\cdot \, d \underline{S}=E(r)\int _{S_{r}}\underline{e}_{r}\cdot \, d \underline{S}  
$$
For a sphere $d \underline{S}=\underline{e}_{r}r^{2}\sin\theta d\theta d\varphi$ in [[Curvilinear Coordinates|spherical coordinates]], soo
$$
E(r)\int _{S_{r}}\underline{e}\cdot \underline{e}_{r} \, dx 
$$

The force between point [[Electric Charge|charges]], $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$, in a vacuum and separated by a distance $r$ is given by:
$$
F=\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r^{2}}
$$
In which $\epsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of free space. By experiment, $\epsilon_{0}=8.85\times 10^{-12}\pu{ Fm-1 }$. It is useful to note that $\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}=9.0\times 10^{9}\pu{ F-1 m}$ to 2 significant figures
## Derivation
In the early 1780s, Charles-Augustin de Coulomb measured the forces between small, charged, [[Electrical Conductors|conducting]] spheres. He used a torsion balance in which the [[Moments|moment]] of the repulsive force on one of the spheres was balanced by the moment due to the twisting of a fibre
![[Coulomb's Law 2024-03-26 17.13.15.excalidraw]]
He found that when the separation between centres and force were related by $F \propto \frac{1}{r^{2}}$ for point charges. We now know that this relationship gives the following:
$$
F=\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r^{2}}
$$
Note that if $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are both positive or both negative, $F$ is positive, so we can interpret a positive $F$ as a repulsive force, if $F$ is negative, then the force is attractive instead. This equation holds almost exactly if the charges are separated by air at ordinary densities. Only when the separating medium is a solid or liquid insulator is the force substantially reduced
